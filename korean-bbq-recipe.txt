Korean BBQ

5 lbs - short ribs
2 cups - soy sauce
2 cups - sugar
chopped garlic (I put a lot!)
1 inch - grated ginger
1 t - sesame oil
1-2 bunches - sliced green onions
sesame seeds (whatever looks like it's enough)
red pepper (flakes, powder, paste...whatever you like)

1. Heat up the soy sauce, sugar, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil in a pot until all the sugar dissolves.
2. Let it cool.
3. Add in the rest of the ingredients into the marinade, then pour it over the meat and mix it all up.
4. Marinate overnight.
